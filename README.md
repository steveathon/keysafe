One of the challenges in working with code is making sure to store your passwords
securely. This little helper is designed so that you can store your passwords in a
simple json file away from your main application directory, thus enabling you to
commit your code without checking for passwords first.

Very beta, but something I was talking with @SYDPHP guys about last night and so
I thought I would share it.

Enjoy at your own risk.
